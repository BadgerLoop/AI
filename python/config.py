			'Elon Musk didn\'t become an American citizen until 2002, at age 31',
			'After graduating, Musk moved to California in order to begin graduate school in physics at Stanford University. He left Stanford after just two days, deciding instead to take advantage of the Internet boom, which was in full swing.',
